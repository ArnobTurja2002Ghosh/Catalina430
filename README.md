# Geometry-Wars-main

This project is inspired from [Catalina430's Geometry Wars](https://github.com/Catalina430/Geometry-Wars) where Catalina430 created a game analogous to the top-down multi-directional shoot 'em up [Geometry Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_Wars).
The purpose of this project is to amalgamate SFML with ImGui.
I could not find Catalina430's contact information through which I could apprise them of my intention to ameliorate their project, so I assumed their approbation, for downloading their project and adulterating it with my code, from their repository being public.

Almost all the SFML part of this project was written by Catalina430 and I appreciate every detail of the graphics from of this SFML part; for example:
- The alpha of a bullet abates in every frame till it is no longer active.

The changes I made are:
- include GUIs such as tabs and checkboxes
  - Unchecking a checkbox will hold the corresponding part of the system in abeyance.
- make spinning of entities independent of movement

Further changes that can be made (listing just a few of them):
- I intend to make the Entity tab more aesthetic with color, layout and what not.
